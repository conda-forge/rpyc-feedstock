  summary: Transparent, Symmetric Distributed Computing

  description: |
    RPyC (pronounced like are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a
    transparent library for symmetrical remote procedure calls,
    clustering, and distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of
    object-proxying, a technique that employs python's dynamic nature, to
    overcome the physical boundaries between processes and computers, so
    that remote objects can be manipulated as if they were local.
